# Danger of Night City
Normal:
 Always sets score to Normal when loading a save.

Hard:
 Enemy spawn count from LNC and DNC get's a bit more chaotic,
Reccommend to be using at least a 1080p-Performance exceeding PC for this.

Chaotic:
 Even more than Hard mode spawn counts.
HIGHLY Reccomend to be using at least a 1440p-ready PC for this.

Why?:
Just. Why?
Jumped the spawn counts pretty high.
PLEASE be using at least a 1440p- Performance exceeding PC for this.

Maximum Overdrive!:
You're a Masochist for using this setting. Absurd spawn Counts and frequencies
WILL Crash systems that can't go passed 1080p, Potentially.
For the love of god, have a Beefy PC on this setting. 

 This setting increases Spawn Count and Variety on Events related to the player needing to defend themselves in.
