# The Life Of Night City


Crowds:
 On the Ambush timer, and depending on your Custom setting 'spawn cap' setting, a variety of new spawns are placed. 
 These spots are typically near any type of service area. 
 As the the day goes into night, more gang members walk amongst the crowds. 

 Activities: 

 -Find a Cop, help them with their quota by looking at one and using  your 'Cycle Custom Interact' binding and select 'quota?' 

 -Want to bring justice on Corpo Creeps? Head to City Center, find a  Female worker, Do as before described above but it's 'Need a hit?' 

 -Hotdog and Asian Food Vendors have interact triggers to them as well. Same as the others, look at one, use your binding, select prompt.",
 
 
 
 
 HOW AN ESCORT MISSION WORKS

-Spawn and run from behind. Once 15m away from you, they ask for their favor. 

-Picking accept, they become friendly attitude ( Cuz cdpr doesnt like civilian companions) . 

-There is a wait_for_trigger action that needs you to be in a car,  so the npc auto sits in it.
